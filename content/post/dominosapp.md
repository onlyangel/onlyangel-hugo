Wao I clearly remember a few years ago that my friend from the Tequila Digital Agency (Specifically Abraham Tonix [@abitonix](https://twitter.com/abitonix) ) convinced Domino's Pizza in Mexico to create their first iOS app. Those were times where for the backend a simple Wordpress installation with a plugin can become a data provider for an app and there were not more requirements than maintaining that server. And also this times people don't trust in mobile technology this wasn't a thing. And now I am proud that Domino's is going to release a version of their app where they invest [65 million pesos](http://expansion.mx/tecnologia/2017/08/10/dominos-invierte-65-millones-de-pesos-en-relanzamiento-de-app). But nowadays is a no brainier to do this sort of things, specially from a brand this big.
