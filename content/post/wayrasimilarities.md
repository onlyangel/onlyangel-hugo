The last few times I had seen the "[Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley)" HBO Series a new character had appear named **[Russ Hanneman][Russ Hanneman]** this character is supposedly *[Mark Cuban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban)* ([Quora](http://www.quora.com/Silicon-Valley-Season-2-Episode-3-Bad-Money/Is-Russ-Hanneman-supposed-to-be-Sean-Parker)). This character adds some interesting (and problematic) interactions into the [Pied Piper Company](http://www.piedpiper.com/). 

The thing that makes me laugh is that at least in my mind, *[Russ Hanneman][Russ Hanneman]* looks really similar to **[Gabriel Charles][Gabriel Charles]** Director of the most importan (and for real life) Startup Accelerator from Mexico **[WAYRA](http://wayra.co/mx)**

If you don't believe me check this photo:

Left **[Gabriel Charles][Gabriel Charles]**, Right **[Russ Hanneman][Russ Hanneman]** (aka. [Chris Diamantopoulos](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224565/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t27))

Well at least in my mind.
